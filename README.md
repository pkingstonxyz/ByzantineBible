# Byzantine Study Bible

This is the repository for the Byzantine Study Bible. My hope for this project is to create a bible entirely in ancient greek that I am happy with, get it printed, and then bound in leather. 

You can feel free to simply take the PDF and do this same process, take the latex files and make it your own, or fork the whole project and modify the python scripts yourself. 

## Text

The texts I'm using are fairly outdated, but they have a license I can safely use. For the New Testament, I'm pleased that the SBL GNT is available for use in this project. The Septuagint is the older Brenton text. This is less than ideal, but it will get the job done certainly.

As for the texts I'll be including:

Old testament
 1. asf
 1. adf
